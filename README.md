# blink
this project consist of three file(Blink.cpp, Blink.h, blink.ino) . 
I made Blink.cpp and Blink.h for library. 
header file(**Blink.h**) has definitions of function and variable for the library: (function: on(int) and off(int), variable: _pin )
source file(**Blink.cpp**) has the actual code: (on(time): turn LED during the time, off(time): off LED during the time )
